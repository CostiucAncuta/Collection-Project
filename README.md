# Collection-Project
Part of the BeCode training.The goal of this project will be to summarize our current knowledge of :  HTML and CSS Responsive design Javascript Basics The DOM

What is it going to be crafted?
Especially since the Covid outbreak, we're all using streaming services such as Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, or even Popcorn Time. We book our holidays on internet with AirBnb, we play games through elaborate clients such as Steam, we care about meaningful reviews on Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB, we can even shop NFTs on online platforms like we would in an art gallery, and many other things...

The common denominator of all those services they all feature a unified stream of content, a collection of some sort. In this challenge we are going to split up the work in two parts to try to replicate this.

Translate this into HTML
You'll have to create a card for each object with javascript and populate it with the properties from that same object.

Make your own design, using grid and/or flex techniques, and create the corresponding HTML skeleton and css file (no frameworks).

Once this is done, you'll have to display your collection in a nice, responsive way into your html body.
